# Deutsch-Joza-Algorithm
The Deutsch-Joza algorithm is one of the most popular quantum algorithms that claims to find out whether a given boolean function is constant (all 'n' bits in the output bit-string will either be 0 or 1) or balanced (exactly half of the 'n' output bits will be 1 and 0) in a single query. Classically, to do the same, in the best case we would require 2 queries and in the worst case we would need $2^(n-1) + 1 queries.  <br />
This repository shows the Qiskit implementation for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in a 3 input qubit system and the generalized version.
